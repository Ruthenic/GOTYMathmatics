The following is a transcription of the formula used in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRBCykRNqf8> plus some of my edits to make it easier to incorporate in code form.  

DPM = $Original MSRP / Metacritic(%)*Avg Playthrough (Mins)  
BCE = Google Searches*Google Searches (With Descriptors) / Negative Google Searches  #i removed the funko pops because honestly thats kinda dumb and also pretty hard to scrape(?)  
FPGPG = Highest FPS*Avg Playthrough (Secs) / Number of Gamers  #gah some of these will be hard to calculate  
GOTY = FPGPG*BCE / DPM   #note i removed the MOM variable because thats kinda hard to get with code
